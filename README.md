# Wind-Tunnel

This project is a low-cost educational wind tunnel designed for aerodynamic testing.
It combines Arduino-based sensors with Python data visualization tools to provide real-time feedback on airflow, lift, drag, and environmental conditions.
The system is modular, so new sensors and calibration methods can be added as the project evolves.
